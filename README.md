## One image per Spring profile

The server is shipped as a GraalVM native executable. Bean definitions are
resolved during ahead-of-time processing at build time, so the active Spring
profile is baked into the executable and cannot be chosen at startup any more.
The server image is therefore built once per profile, via the `SPRING_PROFILE`
build argument:

```bash
podman build --build-arg SPRING_PROFILE=test -t learn-language-server:test server   # e2e pod
podman build --build-arg SPRING_PROFILE=prod -t learn-language-server:prod server   # published image
```

`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` is not read at runtime; the pipeline builds the test
image for the e2e job and the prod image when publishing to Docker Hub. Running
the server on a JVM for local development is unaffected - `mvn spring-boot:run
-Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local` still selects the profile the usual way.

## Port Mapping
